\section{Introduction}
CasinoHoldemAI is a production-grade decision engine for Casino Hold'em, integrating rigorous Monte Carlo simulation with a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier (XGBoost). Key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A configurable Monte Carlo equity estimator with iteration count $N$.
  \item Rich feature extraction combining combinatorial and probabilistic metrics.
  \item A robust XGBoost training pipeline for optimistic CALL/FOLD classification.
\end{itemize}
